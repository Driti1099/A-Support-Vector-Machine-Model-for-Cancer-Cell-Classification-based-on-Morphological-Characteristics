Cancer Cell Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately differentiate between benign and malignant cancer cells based on their characteristics.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- The dataset contains various features such as clump thickness, uniformity of cell size and shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.
- Data types of features are checked to ensure consistency and suitability for analysis.
- Missing values in the 'BareNuc' column are handled by removing rows with non-numeric values.
- The 'BareNuc' feature is converted to integer type for further analysis.

Model Development:
- The dataset is divided into features (X) and the target variable (y) for model training.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are implemented using the scikit-learn library, with different kernels such as Radial Basis Function (RBF), Linear, Polynomial, and Sigmoid.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function.

Model Training and Evaluation:
- SVM classifiers are trained on the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and target labels.
- Model performance is evaluated using various metrics including confusion matrix, classification report, F1-score, and Jaccard index.
- The confusion matrix visualizes the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions of the model.
- Classification reports provide a detailed summary of model performance for each class (benign and malignant).
- F1-score and Jaccard index are calculated to assess the overall accuracy and similarity between true and predicted labels.

Results and Impact:
- The SVM classifiers demonstrate promising performance in accurately classifying cancer cells, with F1-scores indicating robustness in model predictions.
- The project contributes to cancer research by providing a reliable tool for automated classification, potentially aiding in early detection and treatment planning.
  
Future Directions:
- Further optimization of model hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Exploration of ensemble learning techniques for potentially higher accuracy.
- Collaboration with domain experts to incorporate additional features for enhanced predictive capabilities.

This project serves as an introduction to machine learning techniques for cancer classification, showcasing the potential of SVMs in medical diagnostics and contributing to advancements in healthcare technology.
